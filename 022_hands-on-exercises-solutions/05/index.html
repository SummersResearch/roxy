<p>Today is the first day of the rest of my life.  I am on the path to achieving all of my goals for this year.
    Next year will be even better, and I will accomplish so much more.  What will next year bring?

    What will happen next?  All of this cannot be in vain.  What are your New Year's goals.  Where do you go?  Who do you tell?  What do you do next?
