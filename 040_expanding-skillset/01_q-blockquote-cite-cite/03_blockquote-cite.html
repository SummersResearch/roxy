<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/2565.Ian_Fleming">
    <p>Above all, he liked it that everything was one's own fault.  There was only oneself to
    blame.  Luck was a servant and not a master.  Luck had to be accepted with a shrug or taken
    up to the hilt.  But it had to be understood and recognized for what it was and not confuse
    faulty appreciation of the odds, for, at gambling, the deadly sin is to mistake bad play.
    And luck is all its moods had to be loved and not feared.</p>
